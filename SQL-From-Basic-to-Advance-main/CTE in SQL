CTE -> Common Table Expression

CTE is used to simplify the sql query. CTE act as a virtual tables that are created during execution.
We can define CTEs by adding a WITH clause directly 
before the SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or MERGE statement. The WITH clause can include one or more CTEs separated by commas.
